# Aseprite-PlaystationTim
An Aseprite script that allows importing and exporting playstation .tim textures and color pallettes.

## WIP IS A FUCK

Currently, this is the very rushed version I made like, a year ago or so when I was hurrying to replace textures in True OG v1.1 (We won't talk about it). A better README and documentation and shit will come when the script doesn't suck ass.
